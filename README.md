# Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework for Sensing-Aided Communication 

This repository provides the code for a **multimodal realistic simulation framework** using **CARLA** and **MATLAB**. CARLA is used to generate realistic **autonomous driving sensor data**, while MATLAB is employed for **wireless communication simulations**. This framework enables **multimodal sensing data collection**, **3D digital reconstruction**, and **ray-tracing-based wireless channel modeling** to facilitate **beamforming and channel analysis**.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview**  
![Framework Overview](img/framework.png)

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup**  
- **Simulated urban scenarios** with multiple vehicles and base stations in CARLA.  
- Vehicles navigate autonomously, following road layouts and traffic signals.  
- Generates **realistic mobility patterns** and **dynamic sensing conditions** for beamforming and channel evaluation.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Multimodal Sensing Data Generation**  
- At the base station, multiple sensors are deployed to collect multimodal data:  
  - **LiDAR**: Captures 3D point cloud data.  
  - **Radar**: Detects moving objects and their velocities.  
  - **RGB Cameras**: Provides visual scene understanding.  
- CARLA‚Äôs API is used to **synchronize sensor data** with vehicle movements and environmental factors.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ 3D Digital Reconstruction for Communication Simulation**  
- The **CARLA environment is imported into MATLAB** for wireless communication simulation.  
- Since CARLA and MATLAB use different map formats, we employ the **Blender API** for format conversion.  
- This ensures **geometric consistency** between the simulation environments, maintaining accuracy in wireless modeling.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Wireless Channel Simulation with Ray Tracing**  
- The reconstructed 3D environment is used for **ray-tracing-based wireless channel simulations**.  
- **Beamforming impact on RSS (Received Signal Strength)** is analyzed by tracing signal paths and reflections.  
- Enables **precise evaluation of beam selection strategies** in complex urban environments.  

#### **üìå Key Features**  
‚úÖ **Realistic multimodal sensing**: LiDAR, Radar, RGB Cameras integrated into an urban driving environment.
